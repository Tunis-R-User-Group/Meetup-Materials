[Tunis R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/pyladies-tunis/) is part of an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more people become active participants and leaders in the R open-source community. Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse R community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

We are a group of Tunisian ladies passionate about R programming. We launched this new R community in Tunis, Tunisia for anyone interested in programming with the R language.

Tunis R User Group also aims to provide a friendly support network for people and a bridge to the larger R world.

Anyone worldwide with an interest in R is encouraged to participate!
